These guidance signals are transmitted from ground-based facilities and interpreted onboard to display the aircraft's angular deviation from the ideal flight path. ILS can be supplemented with Marker Beacons or DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) to provide distance information in addition to lateral and vertical guidance. An ILS system consists of three main ground components : - LOC (Localizer):Provides lateral guidance. - GP (Glide Path): Provides vertical guidance. - Range: Typically provided by Marker Beacons or DME for distance measurement. ILS approaches are classified as precision approaches because they offer 3D guidance. They are categorized based on decision height (DH) and runway visual range (RVR) : - CAT I: DH > 200 ft, RVR > 550 m - CAT II: DH > 100 ft, RVR > 300 m - CAT III: DH ≥ 0 ft, RVR ≥ 0 m",

    "answer": "The G1000 has a terrain proximity system and it must not be confused with a Terrain awareness system as the G1000 system only serves to enhance terrain awareness and does not provide warning announcements. Terrain Proximity requires the following : - Valid 3D GPS position - Valid Terrain/Obstacles database The system displays altitudes of terrain and obstacles relative to the aircraft altitude and position from the database. However as errors or obstacles not in the database this shall not be used to navigate around terrain. The reference for the system is the GLS (height above geodetic sea level) converted from the GPS altitude that along with the GPS position serves to display a 2D picture of the surrounding terrain and obstacles around the aircraft’s position but also around its flight path. terrain and obstacles are display following a colour coding : - RED, terrain or obstacle above or within 100’ below the aircraft’s altitude. - YELLOW, terrain or obstacle between 100’ and 1000’ below the aircraft’s altitude. - BLACK, terrain or obstacle more than 1000’ below the aircraft’s altitude. Terrain can be displayed on the navigation map along with the flight plan but it can also be displayed in a profile view with VNAV indications along a certain width from the current aircraft track as follow : - Approach, 0.6 NM - Departure, 0.6 NM - Terminal, 2.0 NM - En Route, 4.0 NM - Oceanic, 4.0 NM",

Both GIAs are not connected with each other directly but they serve as the main hub to receive information from all the other LRUs in order to interpret this data and display it to the pilot via the associated GDU. If a GIA failure were to be experienced the other GIA would enter in reversionary mode on the PFD/MFD. If a failure of GIA 1 occurs one should expect to lose COM1/NAV1/GPS1 as well as the PFD FPL entry capability. AHRS/ADC data can still be retrieved by the GIA 2 and displayed on the GDU 2 that switched to reversionary mode and serves as PFD. However if a GIA 2 failure occurs one must expect to lose COM2/NAV2/GPS2 but without significant changes to the PFD.

The K172R is a 28-volt, direct-current (DC) system powered by an engine belt-driven 38 amp alternator and a 24- volt battery. The 172N is a 14-volt, direct current (DC) powered by a engine belt driven 60-amp alternator and a 12-volt battery. Electrical power is distributed through a split-bus system that includes a primary and an essential bus, designed to separate vital components from non-essential loads. The alternator is the primary source of electrical power, while the battery provides backup and supports engine starting. When the engine is running, the alternator supplies power to the electrical system and charges the battery. A voltage regulator maintains system voltage at approximately 28 volts, ensuring proper operation and battery charging. In the event of alternator failure, the battery can supply power for a limited period, and pilots are advised to reduce electrical load to conserve battery life. The electrical system supports all avionics, lighting, flaps, and other electrically operated systems. Circuit breakers protect individual components from overcurrent conditions.

    "question": "How does the C172 fuel system work ?",
    "answer": "Fuel system consists in a gravity-fed design that varies slightly across different models, but its fundamental operation remains consistent. Fuel is stored in two wing tanks—one in each wing—and flows by gravity to a fuel selector valve, typically located between the pilot and copilot seats. The selector allows the pilot to choose LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH, or OFF. In most flight conditions, particularly during takeoff, climb, descent, and landing, the selector is set to BOTH to ensure balanced fuel draw. In cruise, selecting LEFT or RIGHT may be used to correct fuel imbalance. After leaving the selector, fuel passes through a fuel strainer and travels toward the engine compartment, where it is delivered to the engine via either a carburetor (C172N CS-DCU) or a fuel injection system (CK172N, C172S, C172R). While this affects how fuel is metered and delivered to the engine, it does not significantly change the layout of the fuel delivery system leading up to that point. Some models, particularly those with fuel injection (like the C172R and C172S), include both an engine-driven fuel pump and an auxiliary electric fuel pump. The electric pump provides backup pressure during engine start and as a contingency in case the engine-driven pump fails. In carbureted models like the 172N and P, there is no need for an auxiliary electric pump since gravity alone is sufficient.",

    "question": "What are the C172 Flaps type ?",
    "answer": "The Cessna 172R is equipped with single-slot wing flaps that are electrically operated and designed to improve the aircraft's lift and drag characteristics during takeoff, approach, and landing. Flap settings can be selected in increments of 0°, 10°, 20°, and 30° (40º in C172N) using a lever located on the center console between the front seats. When the flap lever is moved, an electric motor actuates the flaps accordingly. Extending the flaps increases lift, allowing for slower approach speeds and steeper descent angles, but also adds drag, especially beyond 20°, which significantly reduces climb performance. Exceeding VFE speed with flaps extended could cause structural damage. The flap system includes mechanical stops and circuit protection to prevent over-extension. In comparison, older models like the Cessna 172N had flap systems that could extend up to 40°, providing even more drag for steep descents, though this setting was later limited in newer models like the 172R to improve climb performance and reduce stress on the airframe. Pilots are advised to use flaps as needed but always monitor airspeed and flap position indicators to ensure safe operation, especially in go-around maneuvers.",

    "answer": "The airspeed indicator works by measuring the pressure difference between the pitot tube (which senses ram air pressure) and the static port (which senses ambient air pressure). This differential pressure is converted into KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) and displayed on the instrument. The indicator is color-coded with arcs representing operating speed ranges: C172N: White arc (41 to 85 knots), green arc (47 to 128 knots), yellow arc (128 to 160 knots), and a red radial line (160 knots). C172R: White arc (33 to 85 knots), green arc (44 to 129 knots), yellow arc (129 to 163 knots), and a red radial line (163 knots). The instrument incorporates a true airspeed (TAS) window, allowing TAS to be read directly from the face of the dial. Additionally, there is a window at the six o’clock position that displays true airspeed and a window at the twelve o’clock position that displays pressure altitude overlaid with a temperature scale. To determine true airspeed: - Identify the current pressure altitude and outside air temperature (OAT). - Rotate the lower-left knob to align the pressure altitude with the OAT on the scale. - Read the resulting true airspeed from the indicated window.",

It uses a vacuum-powered gyroscope mounted horizontally, which maintains rigidity in space, allowing the instrument to reflect the plane's movement around it. The gyro is spun by suction from an engine-driven vacuum pump. The instrument displays a miniature airplane against a fixed horizon bar; as the aircraft pitches or banks, the miniature moves accordingly. A curved scale above the horizon bar marks standard bank angles (10°, 20°, 30°, and 60°) for reference. Though reliable, the instrument can experience precession—minor errors caused by prolonged turns or abrupt maneuvers.

    "question": "How does the altimeter work ?",
    "answer": "The altimeter measures altitude by sensing atmospheric pressure, which decreases as altitude increases. Inside the instrument is a sealed, flexible aneroid barometer (a stack of wafers) that expands or contracts in response to changes in external air pressure. These movements are mechanically linked to needles on the altimeter face, which indicate the aircraft’s altitude above sea level. As the aircraft climbs and air pressure drops, the wafers expand, moving the needles to show a higher altitude. During descent, increasing pressure causes the wafers to compress, and the indicated altitude decreases. The altimeter typically uses three needles to display altitude: a needle for tens of thousands of feet, a medium-length needle for thousands, and a long needle for hundreds. To maintain accuracy, the pilot adjusts the altimeter using the Kollsman window, which sets the current barometric pressure. This setting is usually given in hectopascals (hPa) in Portugal and Europe (e.g., 1013.2 hPa), and in inches of mercury (in. Hg) in countries like the United States (e.g., 29.92 in. Hg). Setting the correct pressure ensures the altimeter properly reflects altitude rather than changes caused by weather systems.",

    "question": "What are the errors associated with the altimeter ?",
    "answer": "Though reliable, the altimeter can give incorrect readings if the pressure setting is wrong or if weather-related pressure changes are not accounted for. When transitioning from a high-pressure system to a low-pressure system, if the altimeter pressure setting is not adjusted, the instrument will overread, indicating a higher altitude than the actual one. Conversely, when moving from a low-pressure system to a high-pressure system without updating the altimeter, it will underread, suggesting you are at a lower altitude than you truly are. To help remember these concepts, consider these handy phrases: \"From high to low, lookout below.\" \"From low to high, lookout to the sky.\" These sayings serve as reminders to adjust your altimeter when pressure changes, ensuring accurate altitude readings during flight.",

    "question": "How does the turn coordinator work ?",
    "answer": "The Turn Coordinator is an instrument that helps understand two things during a turn: the rate at which the aircraft is turning and whether the turn is coordinated, meaning balanced and properly controlled with both aileron and rudder. Inside the Turn Coordinator, there is a small, electrically powered gyroscope that spins rapidly. The gyroscope is mounted at an angle — specifically, canted upward at about 30 degrees — which allows it to sense both yaw (side-to-side motion of the nose) and a small amount of roll (banking motion of the wings). When the aircraft begins to turn, the yaw motion causes the spinning gyroscope to experience a force called gyroscopic precession. This force causes the gyro’s housing to move, and that motion is mechanically linked to a pointer on the instrument face. As the aircraft turns, this pointer banks in the direction of the turn. If it aligns with the white tick marks on the dial, the aircraft is turning at a standard rate of 3 degrees per second, which would complete a full 360-degree turn in two minutes. Beneath the main display is a small curved tube with a metal ball inside — this is called the inclinometer, or simply “the ball.” It shows whether the aircraft is in a coordinated turn. When the airplane is turning correctly, the ball stays in the center. If the airplane is slipping (too little rudder), the ball moves to the inside of the turn. If the airplane is skidding (too much rudder), the ball moves to the outside. Pilots correct this by using the rudder — applying pressure to the pedal on the same side the ball has moved to, following the rule: \"step on the ball.\"",

Magnetos delivers this voltage to the spark plugs at the right moment in the engine’s cycle. As the engine turns, it rotates the magnet inside the magneto, passing through the coil’s magnetic field. The rotating magnet induces a small current in the primary coil. At a precise moment (based on engine timing), the breaker points open. This interrupts the primary current. The collapsing magnetic field induces a much higher voltage (15,000–20,000+ volts) in the secondary coil. This high-voltage pulse is routed via the distributor to the correct spark plug, igniting the air-fuel mixture.",

When travelling backwards the slipstream hits the vertical stabiliser, because it meets with an angle and the vertical stabiliser is an aerofoil it causes an aerodynamic force. The aerodynamic force acts around the aircraft CoG causing the aircraft to develop a tendency to yaw left (for CW rotating propellers). This effect varies with speed, as speed increases the slipstream straightens out causing the yawing moment to reduce.

    "question": "What are the forces acting on a propeller ?",
    "answer": "A propeller blade produces an aerodynamic force the same way a wing produces it. On a propeller blade we can observe the following forces : Normal Reaction → The aerofoil shape of the propeller blade generates an aerodynamic force perpendicular to the relative airflow. This force acts at an angle to the airflow, contributing to the thrust.This force varies depending on the angle of attack of the blade, which can change with the RPM and TAS of the aircraft. Thrust → The primary purpose of the propeller is to generate thrust by accelerating air backward.This force acts along the axis of the propeller, at right angle with the plane of rotation.The thrust force is generated by the pressure differential between the front (leadingedge) and the rear (trailing edge) of the propeller blades. Torque Drag → It arises due to the twisting moment (torque) required to turn the propeller. When the engine drives the propeller, it imparts rotational motion to the blades, which requires energy. As the blades cut through the air, they produce aerodynamic forces (thrust and lift), but these forces also create resistance in the form of drag (profile + induced). Shaft Torque → It is the rotational force applied to the propeller by the engine via the driveshaft. This is the direct force required to rotate the propeller blades, and it is a function of the power output of the engine and the propeller’s design. Shaft torque is the moment that drives the propeller to rotate. Centrifugal Force → The rotating propeller blade experiences centrifugal force due to its rotation. This forceacts outward from the center of rotation, attempting to stretch the blade away from its hub. The magnitude of this force increases with RPM. Centripetal Force → It acts on the propeller blades due to the rotation of the propeller. As the blades spin around the hub, they experience an inward-directed force that tends to pull them toward the center of rotation. This force is responsible for causing the blades to bend and flex, as they are subject to centrifugal forces acting outward from the hub.",

  },
  {
    "id": 260,
    "question": "How do these forces vary with TAS and RPMs ?",
    "answer": "With RPMs : - As RPM increases, the tip speed of the propeller blades increases, which increases the thrust generated by the propeller (up to a certain point). This is because the propeller blades are moving through the air more quickly, resulting in a greater acceleration of the air and a higher pressure differential between the front and rear of the blades. - Centrifugal force also increases with RPM, placing more stress on the blade and increasing the potential for blade flexing. - The angle of attack of the blades may change, especially in variable-pitch propellers,affecting the lift and drag generated. A higher RPM can lead to a steeper angle of attack at higher speeds, which might lead to higher thrust production but also greater drag. With TAS : - As airplane speed increases, the relative velocity of the airflow over the propeller blades increases. This means that the angle of attack required to produce the same amount of thrust may decrease. Higher airspeeds generally result in lower AoA for a given thrust output, which can reduce the drag on the blades. - Induced drag decreases with increasing speed, as the airflow over the blades becomes more streamlined and the blades encounter less resistance. - For constant RPM, the propeller blades might be less effective at higher speeds, as the increase in relative airflow reduces the need for a higher angle of attack and lift generation. - Pitch Angle: At higher airspeeds, if the aircraft has a controllable-pitch propeller, the blades may automatically adjust their pitch to maintain an optimal angle of attack,reducing drag while maintaining thrust.",

    "question": "How is Lift generated on a conventional aerofoil ?",
    "answer": "The total reaction is formed by a pressure differential acting over the wing, the magnitude of this force relies on the dynamic pressure of the airflow. The total reaction may be developed in 2 forces : - LIFT : Lift is the component of the total reaction force perpendicular to the relative airflow. - DRAG : Drag is the component of the total reaction force horizontal to the relative airflow. Lift can be written as an equation : L =1/2 p V²SCl The Lift Coefficient gives us the amount of lift produced per unit area and per unit dynamic pressure, It depends on the following aerofoil characteristics : - AoA : Increasing the AoA will result in increasing the pressure differential around the aerofoil and thus the Lift up until Clmax where we reach AoAcrit and the stalling angle causing a decrease in Lift. - Thickness : It allows for the Clmax to be higher allowing us a more important increase in Lift using the AoA previously covered.  - Camber : It will cause the aerofoil to have the ability to produce lift at 0° AoA by causing an increase in the airflow velocity and thus dynamic pressure. AoAcrit remains the same and in order to produce 0 Lift the associated AoA is negative. - Flaps : Camber is also affected by the use of flaps. Using flaps causes the AoA to increase as the chord line changes. The use of flaps allows for Clmax to increase but the AoAcrit reduces",

    "question": "What is the 3D airflow affecting an aerofoil ?",
    "answer": "We can observe a span wise flow acting on the aerofoil, this flow is affected by : - The air mass flow inertia - Local Pressure differences around the aircraft The flow speed will entirely depends on the pressure gradient of the aerofoil Wing Tip Vortex → We can determine that on an aerofoil developing Lift we have a relatively low pressure on the top surface of the wing due to the flow acceleration and a relatively high pressure on the wing lower surface. As we know the tendency is for the air to flow from the higher pressure to the lower pressure, because of this tendency at the wing tip the airflow underneath the wing will whip around the wing tip to the lower pressure. As the aircraft is moving and this isn't a static situation this creates a vortex as the wing flow the air starts to rotate. This process occurs at both wingtips and the air flows towards the aircraft (Left wing to the Right and Right wing to the Left). Factors affecting Vortex intensity : - Pressure differential : The greater the press diff the greater the lift produced and thus the greater the intensity of the vortex. No press diff No Vortex. - Time to act on the airflow : Because air as inertia it takes a definite force to cause an acceleration, we can say that a slow-moving wing will produce more intense vortex as it as more time to act on the air while a fast-moving wing will produce less intense vortex as it has less time to act on the airflow. - Aspect Ratio : when the chord is long it has more time to affect the airflow causing more intense vortex while a narrower chord will not affect the air during enough time to cause intense vortex. Effects of wing tip vortex : - Downwash : As each wingtip vortex is rotating downwards it drags the surrounding air with it. - Drag : A vortex creates a large rotational energy that is provided by the aircraft and felt as drag. - Wake : Vortex are highly energetic flows and can reach rotations of 300’/s being a severe hazard for lighter aircrafts. SpanWise Flow → We can also observe a pressure gradient acting along the wing. This gradient isn’t as strong as the wing tip vortices. As we previously stated we find a relatively lower pressure on the top of the wing and a slightly higher pressure below the wing. The most intense area of high/low pressure depending on the side of the wing is found at the root, this causes a flow to develop span wise from the root to the tip underneath the wing and from the tip to the root on the top of the wing. This spanwise flow causes trailing edge vortices when those 2 flows meet at an angle at the trailing edge. Their strength will depend on the angle at which they meet, furthermore the trailing edge vortices closer to the wing tip add strength to the wing tip vortices creating more downwash. Effective Airflow → A wing operates in a 3d airflow, this is an airflow that has horizontal and vertical velocities. The combination of those velocities creates the effective airflow that is at an angle with the relative airflow. This effective airflow is the one that determines the wing aerodynamic forces.",

    "question": "What is Induced drag and what factors affect it ?",
    "answer": "Because the aerodynamic force is determined by the effective airflow as stated previously and because this airflow is at an angle with the relative airflow the difference between the two is the induced AoA. Whenever Lift is created, induced drag is also produced by the wing. Induced drag depends on the lift produced and the intensity of the wing tip vortices causing downwash, increasing the angle difference between EAF/RAF and thus increasing the induced AoA. Induced AoA is the angle between the EAF/RAF and depends on the following : - TAS : lower TAS, higher vortices, more downwash, higher induced AoA, higher induced drag - VS caused by the downwash : more downwash, higher induced AoA, higher induced drag Factors Influencing Induced Drag are the following : Speed → Induced drag is inversely proportional to speed² - Increase in speed : Increasing speed causes a reduction in Cl for the same amount of L produced, this causes a reduction in the press gradient causing less wing tip vortices, less downwash and thus less induced drag. - Decrease in speed : Decreasing speed causes an increase in Cl for the same amount of L produced, this causes an increase in the press. gradient causing more wing tip vortices, more downwash and thus more induced drag. Weight →Induced drag is proportional to weight - Increase in weight : More weight requires more Lift to be produced, it requires a higher press diff, causing more wing tip vortices, more downwash and thus more induced drag - Decrease in weight : Less weight requires less Lift to be produced, it requires a lower press diff, causing less wing tip vortices, less downwash and thus less induced drag Maneuvers & load factor → A maneuver requires more Lift to be produced in order to balance the weight and the forces caused by the maneuver. More lift requires a higher press diff, causing more wing tip vortices, more downwash and thus more induced drag. Aspect Ratio → Induced drag is inversely proportional to AR - High AR : Smaller vortices created, causing less downwash and thus less induced drag. - Low AR : Greater vortices created, causing more downwash and thus more induced drag.",

    "question": "What is stability ?",
    "answer": "Equilibrium is a state where the sum of all the forces and moments acting on an aircraft are 0. Small upsets act on the balance of these forces and moments causing the aircraft to depart from equilibrium changing the size of the lift force produced. Stability is the capacity for an aircraft to produce restoring moments in order to automatically bring back the aircraft to a state of equilibrium. An ideal aircraft is stable and responsive but those characteristics oppose each other, the more stable the less responsive and inversely. We consider two types of stability : - Static Stability, referring to the immediate response of an object when displaced from equilibrium - Dynamic Stability, referring to the subsequent response over time Within Static Stability we can find : Positive Static Stability → The object has a tendency to go back to equilibrium after being disturbed even if it may not reach equilibrium. Neutral Static Stability → The object acquires the state after being disturbed it doesn’t go back nor diverge from equilibrium. Negative Static Stability → The object has a tendency to diverge from equilibrium never returning to its initial position. Within Dynamic Stability we can find : Positive Dynamic Stability → - Periodic motion : The object will overshoot equilibrium before returning towards it, this tendency damps with time. The greater the damping force the greater the positive dynamic stability - Aperiodic motion : The object will return to equilibrium steadily without oscillating around it. Neutral Dynamic Stability → - Periodic motion : The object will oscillate but suffers from no damping forces, it never reaches equilibrium but nor is it diverging from it. - Aperiodic motion : The object does not oscillate but never reaches equilibrium nor diverges from it. Negative Dynamic Stability → - Periodic motion : The object oscillates and it increasingly diverges from equilibrium over time. - Aperiodic motion : The object steadily diverges from the equilibrium.",

    "question": "What is a stall and what are the factors affecting it ?",
    "answer": "In order to maintain level flight at low speed you must increase the AoA in order to increase the Cl, but as the AoA/Cl increase it reaches a point where the airflow is not longer able to overcome the steepening angle and adverse press grad causing it to lose energy up to a point where a significant amount of energy is lost and the airflow separates from the wing causing the wing to stall. At positive AoA the stagnation point on the LE of the wing sits below the LE air that has to bend around it to flow over the wing upper surface. As AoA increases this stagnation point moves further below and the airflow has to overcome a tighter turn in order for it to flow over the upper surface this causes the airflow to lose consequent energy. Also at high AoA the adverse press grad is greatest due to the greater press diff on the wing. When the AoA increases the adverse press grad covers more distance over the upper wing while it increases in strength, this causes the separation point to move fwd and consequently less distance is available for the airflow to produce lift. Factors affecting stall : Weight → As an aircraft is heavier it needs more Lift to counterbalance the weight. To that it either need to fly faster or at a higher AoA. But as the wing stalls at the same AoAcrit so weight is going to affect Vs. As it needs to fly faster the Vs will also be higher so we can say that Vs varies proportionally with Vs². Altitude → At high altitude we encounter a significant reduction in density, this increases the difference between EAS/TAS. At the higher TAS the air has less time to change direction approaching the wing this causes huge energy loss weakening the ability of the air to overcome the wing adverse pressure gradient causing a stall at a lower AoAcrit and also at a higher Vs. Load Factor → Considering a steep turn, load factor > 1 and thus the Lift produced is also higher meaning we have more pressure difference on the wing this also means that we have a steeper adverse pressure gradient for the airflow to overcome. Because the air has the same energy but tries to overcome a steeper gradient it loses energy at a higher rate causing it to separate at higher speeds. Flaps → The use of flaps allows us to increase the wing Clmax and to fly slower while still having a margin above the stall. The use of flaps allow us to reduce Vs but also reduces our AoAcrit meaning we can fly slower but we stall at a lower AoA as flaps increase the wing AoA. Slats → The use of slats allows us to compensate for the effects of the flaps and reduce our AoAcrit as slats modify the flow around the wing. The suction peak is reduced allowing a lower adverse pressure gradient causing the wing to stall a higher AoA and achieve a greater Clmax.",

    "question": "What is the best gliding speed and what is it used for ?",
    "answer": "Best glide speed is the airspeed at which an aircraft can travel the furthest distance forward while losing the least amount of altitude, making it the most efficient speed for gliding when there is no engine power available. Flying at this speed allows the aircraft to make the best use of its altitude to reach a safe landing area, as published in the aircraft’s manual based on its aerodynamic design. This speed can vary slightly with aircraft weight, requiring a higher glide speed for heavier loads to maintain the best glide ratio. Wind conditions also play a role: flying slightly faster into a headwind or slightly slower with a tailwind helps optimize distance. Crucially, flying faster or slower than the best glide speed will reduce the maximum distance you can cover, as both excess drag from higher speeds and increased sink rate from slower speeds will decrease overall gliding efficiency. Best glide speed is always flown in a clean configuration, with landing gear and flaps retracted unless specified otherwise, and is essential knowledge for emergency situations.",

This marks the later stage of a frontal system’s life cycle and often brings complex weather patterns. There are two types of occlusions depending on the relative temperatures of the air masses involved: Cold Occlusion: The cold air behind the front is colder than the cool air ahead. As the cold front catches up, it lifts both the warm air and the cool air ahead of the warm front. Warm Occlusion: The cold air behind the front is warmer than the cold air ahead. In this case, the overtaking front rides up and over the denser, colder air ahead. Before the passage: Conditions resemble those ahead of a warm front. Temperatures are relatively mild, and clouds gradually increase—starting with high-level cirrus and cirrostratus, followed by altostratus and nimbostratus. Light to moderate, steady precipitation begins. Atmospheric pressure slowly decreases, winds are from the southeast or south, and the dew point rises. During the passage: In a cold occlusion, temperatures drop noticeably as the colder air replaces the less-cold air at the surface. In a warm occlusion, temperatures may remain steady or even rise slightly, since warmer air replaces colder air at the surface. In both cases, pressure reaches its minimum and then begins to rise. Winds shift (usually becoming northwesterly or westerly), and precipitation can intensify. Cloud cover is thick and low—typically nimbostratus, with possible embedded cumulonimbus in more active systems. Thunderstorms are possible if enough instability is present. Visibility is poor but may start to improve. After the passage: The weather gradually clears. In a cold occlusion, temperatures remain cool or drop further. In a warm occlusion, milder air may persist briefly before cooling resumes.

This type of ice is typically found in cumulus clouds or areas of freezing rain, where droplet sizes are larger. It is particularly dangerous because it can build up quickly and unevenly, often extending beyond the reach of de-icing systems. Its weight and the way it disrupts airflow can significantly degrade aircraft performance. Rime ice forms when small supercooled water droplets strike the aircraft and freeze instantly upon contact. This rapid freezing traps air bubbles, resulting in a rough, opaque, and brittle coating that appears milky or white. Rime ice tends to form in stratiform clouds, where the water droplets are smaller. While it’s usually lighter than clear ice and easier to remove, rime ice still disrupts the smooth airflow over the wings and control surfaces, which can lead to aerodynamic inefficiencies. Mixed ice, which forms when both large and small supercooled droplets are present in the same environment—often in cumulonimbus clouds or regions where different types of cloud layers intersect. Mixed ice is a combination of clear and rime, resulting in a lumpy, irregular surface that is both heavy and aerodynamically disruptive. This type of ice can be very challenging to remove and poses one of the greatest risks to aircraft, especially if the aircraft is not equipped with advanced anti-icing systems. Hoar frost develops on the ground, typically overnight, when moisture in the air condenses and freezes onto cold aircraft surfaces. It appears as a thin layer of white, feathery crystals and can be easily overlooked. However, even a small amount of hoar frost on a wing can disturb airflow enough to increase stall speed or degrade lift, making proper pre-flight inspection and removal essential.",

    "question": "What is the freezing level and how can it influence your flight ?",
    "answer": "The freezing level is the altitude in the atmosphere at which the temperature drops to 0ºC, freezing point of water.. In ISA conditions the freezing level would be at 7,500ft but it constantly varies depending on the conditions. Flying through clouds, rain or snow in this zone increases the risk of ice forming on wings, control surfaces and sensors.",

    "question": "What is Freezing Rain/Drizzle (FZRA/FZDZ) ?",
    "answer": "Freezing rain and drizzle consist of supercooled water droplets (SCWD), which can be up to 500 microns in size. Supercooled water droplets are liquid water droplets that remain in liquid form even though their temperature is below 0°C. This occurs because there are no nuclei/particles or surfaces present to trigger freezing. Under certain conditions, water can remain in a liquid state well below freezing — sometimes as cold as -40°C. These conditions are extremely dangerous due to the extensive ice accretion that can occur on parts of the airframe not normally prone to ice buildup — for example, side windows, the upper and lower surfaces of the wing aft of the protected (anti-ice/de-ice) areas, as well as on the propeller or sensor probes.",

    "question": "What are the different types of fogs ?",
    "answer": "Radiation Fog → It forms overnight or when land loses heat up to the dew point or close to it. The fog is often patchy and low. It may spread and become more dense throughout the night. Depth Varies from a few feets up to 1500’. Conditions to form : High Relative Humidity, Light winds (2-8 KTS), Clear skies and long nights. The cooling of the ground will cause the air layer closest to it to become colder than above layers resulting in a nocturnal inversion. Sun radiations cause the air to become warmer and also cause thermal turbulence allowing for hot dry air to be mixed with cool humid air below. An increase in wind speed also causes the fog to disperse due to mechanical mixing. Fog may lift into a Stratus or Stratocumulus. Advection Fog → It is formed when warm, moist, stable air moves over a colder surface causing it to cool up to the dew point. It usually happens in temperate regions adjacent to the coast or over land in winter over frozen or snow-covered surfaces.It will clear when there is a change in air mass or when the wind will lift it up into a cloud. Evaporation, steam, arctic smoke → It forms when relatively cold, stable air lies over a relatively warm, moist surface. The cold air causes the evaporation of the moist warm air to condense forming fog. It can occur over lakes, rivers and seas. Frontal Fog → It forms near a front when rain falling from a relatively warm air mass saturates in the cooler air close to the air in front of the front. Hill, Up-slope Fog → It occurs when air is forced to rise up a hill or a mountain and to cool adiabatically causing the air to cool up to the dew point.To an observer off the mountain it appears as clouds but to an observer on the mountain it appears as fog.",

    "question": "How can we determine if the atmosphere is stable or unstable ?",
    "answer": "In order to determine if the atmosphere is either stable or unstable we must compare temperature lapse rates. The temperature lapse rate represents the rate at which a rising air pacel cools but it also determines if when rising it will continue rising, settle or sink back. We compare the following three lapse rates : - ELR - Environmental Lapse Rate This represents the actual rate at which air temperature decreases with altitude. - DALR - Dry Air Lapse Rate This represents the rate at which dry air temperature decreases with altitude (-3°C/1000’). - SALR - Saturated Air Lapse Rate This represents the rate at which saturated air temperature decreases with altitude (-1,8°C/1000’). Knowing these three parameters we can determine the following atmosphere conditions : - Stable The atmosphere is said to be stable when the ELR is < to the SARL and DALR. - Unstable The atmosphere is said to be unstable when the ELR is > to the SARL and DALR. - Conditionally unstable The atmosphere is said to be conditionally unstable when the ELR is SALR < < DALR.",

    "answer": "A jet stream is a narrow band of airflow with a wind velocity greater than 60 KTS, those high velocity airflows are found at high altitude and occur due to important temperature differences between air masses. They usually develop within the warm air side. We observe 4 jet streams around the globe : Subtropical Jet Stream → This jet stream is permanent in both hemispheres and is located at the boundary of Hadleyand Ferrel cells. It occurs around FL400 but varies during the year, they are found around 25°to 40° N-S in Winter and 40° to 45° in Summer.

    "question": "Types of Radio Wave propagation",
    "answer": "Radio waves are categorized depending on how they propagate : Space Waves → They propagate through the air directly from Tx to Rx, they are limited in range as they require line-of-sight between Tx/Rx and they are not reflected by the ionosphere. Their primary limiting factor is Earth’s curvature and terrain. This means of propagation is usually of higher frequencies (VHF, UHF, SHF, EHF). Sky Waves → They are created due to the refraction within the E and F layer of the ionosphere. This process allows very long distances to be achieved if the transmission power is sufficient. This usually affects lower frequencies as higher frequency causes the diffraction to decrease. Ground (Surface) Waves → They travel along Earth’s surface and the ionosphere allowing them to propagate along a considerable distance. Those waves are usually composed of a surface wave, a direct space wave and an indirect space wave (reflected). This means of propagation is usually of lower frequencies (VLF, LF, MF, HF).",

    "question": "Factors affecting radio waves propagation",
    "answer": "Radio wave propagation is affected by multiple factors that may cause signal weakening or blockage : Antenna Shadowing → It occurs when the line-of-sight between Tx and Rx antennas is either partially or fully blocked by terrain, building,... as a result the antenna collects less radiation. Reflection → It occurs when the radio wave reflects off a surface such as terrain, buildings, water droplets,... it may cause a degradation of the signal’s quality. Refraction → It refers to the change in direction of the radio wave due to changes in propagation speed and wavelengths. This is the principle used for sky waves. Diffraction → It occurs when a radio passes around or through an obstacle causing a diffraction if the obstacle is bigger than the wavelength of the wave. This îs the principle used for ground waves. Multipath Propagation → It may occur when a signal is reflected from surfaces and arrives at the receiver via more than one path involving changes in both directions of the signal and the path causing navigational anomalies in some equipment. Absorption → It refers to the matter absorbing radio wave energy changing it into heat for exemple and causing the wave to be attenuated. Attenuation → It consists of the weakening or cancellation of the radio signal. Superposition and Interference → It refers to two or more signals with similar carrier waves interfering with each other which may produce noise or cancelling the radio signal. Fading → Is a random process affecting radio waves and can be due to multipath propagation, weather or shadowing.",

The transmission's main means of propagation is Ground Wave. Ech NDB is uniquely identified with 2-3 letters transmitted in Morse Code either in a Continuous Wave requiring a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BFO) or in a Modulated Continuous Wave Amplitude Modulated (AM). The aircraft equipment uses a directional aerial to sense the direction of the signal and thus the NDB. On the display pilots are able to read QDM (needle head) and QDR (needle tail).

The lower part of this band is shared with ILS from 108.000 to 111.975 MHz, within this band frequencies with an odd decimal are dedicated to ILS. VORs are identified by their own 3 letter morse identification code.

Within VORs stations we observe different categories as High altitude (H), Low altitude (L) or Terminal (T) and the following type of operations : - Enroute VOR - TVOR Terminal - VOT Test - BVOR Broadcast VOR operations rely on the transmission of 2 independent signals on the same frequency, a Reference Phase signal (RP), and a Variable Phase signal (VP). Both signals are received by the aircraft receiver at different time/phase, the phase difference allows the definition of the radial on which the receiver is located.

The system comprises : - Airborne equipment : Interrogator - Ground equipment : Transponder DME stations operate within the UHF frequency band, but using two frequencies separated by 63 MHz, one for the interrogation signal and the other for the reply. However this system has a limited capacity of approximately 100 aircrafts, the 100 strongest signals are answered by the station. DMEs stations are identified by a 3 letter morse code transmitted once every 40s, if a VOR is associated the VOR ident is transmitted 3x and the DME ident x1 at a higher frequency. We can consider 3 categories of DMEs : - DME/N, Standard DME ranging up to 200NM with +- 0,25 nm / +1,25 of Range - DME/P, Precision DME used for MLS operations - Terminal DME, Collocated with other navaids and provides a 0 reading at the touchdown point - TACAN, military UFH tactical aid to navigation providing bearing + distance As mentioned above DME provides Slant Range taking into account the aircraft height causing the reading to be greater than the actual ground distance the aircraft is from the station. This difference increases with the distance and the height of the aircraft, the closer the aircraft the greater the difference. Ground Range=(slant range)² + (height)² Navigation with DMEs : - Rho-Rho fix, combines two DME arcs of specified distances. - Rho-Theta, combines a specific DME distance with a specific VOR radial. - DME Arc, aircrafts are required to maintain a specific distance from the station to fly an arc.",

    "question": "Emergency Transponder codes\r",
    "answer": "Pilots operating an aircraft equipped with a transponder are required to set specific codes during certain emergency situations. These codes help ATC identify the nature of the emergency quickly and efficiently, even if radio communication is not possible. There are three standard emergency transponder codes, each corresponding to a specific type of emergency: Code 7500 — Unlawful Interference (Hijacking): This code is used when the aircraft is subjected to unlawful interference, such as a hijacking or any situation where the aircraft's control is being compromised by unlawful means. Setting this code discreetly informs ATC of the situation without the need for verbal communication, which might not be possible or safe during such an event. ATC will respond appropriately, often without directly referencing the code to avoid escalating the situation. Code 7600 — Radio Communication Failure: This code is set when the aircraft experiences a total radio communication failure. By setting 7600, the pilot informs ATC that they are unable to communicate via radio. ATC will recognize this and attempt to provide instructions through other means, such as visual signals or via relay through other aircraft, while the pilot follows established procedures for lost communications. Code 7700 — General Emergency (Mayday): This code is used for any other general emergency situation that does not involve unlawful interference or communication failure, such as engine failure, fire on board, medical emergencies, or other critical situations requiring immediate attention. Setting 7700 alerts all radar-equipped ATC units and other aircraft that the aircraft is in an emergency state, prompting an immediate priority response from ATC. It is important to note that these codes are recognized internationally and should only be used in the situations described. Incorrect use can cause unnecessary emergency responses and confusion.",

(2) Set transponder code #7600. (b) Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) (1) Set transponder code #7600. (2) in airspace without radar coverage: Maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 20 minutes following the aircraft's failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan. (3) In Airspace with radar coverage: Maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes after: (i) the time the last assigned level or minimum flight altitude is reached; or (ii) the time the transponder is set to code #7600; or (iii) the aircraft's failure to report its position over a compulsory reporting point. whichever is later, and thereafter adjust level and speed in accordance with the filed flight plan. 65 (4) when radar vectored or offset: Rejoin current flight plan route no later than the next significant point. (c) Further steps (1) Proceed according to the current flight plan route to the appropriate designated navigation aid or fix serving the destination aerodrome. (2) Hold if necessary, over this aid until the expected approach time last received and acknowledged or as close as possible to, the estimated time of arrival resulting from the current flight plan. (3) Complete a normal instrument approach procedure as specified for the designated navigation aid or fix land, if possible, within 30 minutes after the estimated time of arrival or the last acknowledged expected approach time, whichever is later. What to expect from ATC: “ASSIST” principle: - Acknowledge the RCF, determine if it is a partial or complete Radio Communication Failure (RCF). - Separate the aircraft (accordingly, identified vs. unknown traffic) and if necessary, allow long final, keep the active runway clear of departures, arrivals, and vehicles. - Silence the non-urgent calls (as required), look for means to establish possible relay by other stations. - Inform the supervisor and all concerned Air Traffic Controller (ATC) units as well as airport authorities at the destination or alternative aerodrome. - Support the flight by transmitting blind and providing any information considered necessary such as type of approach, runway length and aerodrome details, etc. - Time provided for the crew to assess the situation and adhere to the RCF procedures",

Even if the aircraft pitches, rolls, or yaws, the gyroscope maintains its original plane of rotation. Instruments such as the attitude indicator and heading indicator use this principle to display reliable information about the aircraft’s orientation. - Precession: When a force is applied to a spinning gyroscope, it reacts 90 degrees from the point of force application in the direction of rotation. This phenomenon, called precession, is used in the turn coordinator to indicate the rate and direction of turns. As the aircraft begins a turn, the gyroscopic instrument tilts according to the applied force, allowing it to display the aircraft's rate of turn accurately.",

    "question": "Describe frontal thunderstorms.",
    "answer": "Frontal storms occur where a cold air mass undercuts a warm air mass. Thunderstorms are most likely to develop just ahead of the cold front at the point where the cold front curls under itself (the cold nose). This cold nose is caused by the greater friction at the surface which holds back the advance of the lowest part of the leading edge of the cold front. The cold nose puts warm air under the cold air which greatly increases the lapse rate and leads to significant instability. Towering cumulus and embedded thunderstorms form within the surrounding stratiform cloud which makes them very difficult to see",

    "question": "What are the threats associated with icing?",
    "answer": "- Increases the aircraft’s mass which increases the stall speed. - Increases the aircraft’s drag which increases the power required. - Alters the lift characteristics of the wing, causing loss of lift, lift dissymmetry and unpredictable stall characteristics. - Builds up in jet engine air intakes reducing the inflow to the engine resulting in loss of power or engine surge. - Builds up on jet engine fans and inlet guide vanes resulting in loss of power and/or engine surge/stall. - May jam control surfaces. - It can cover windscreens, limiting forward visibility. It can cause malfunctioning of aircraft sensors.",

    "question": "Differences between Rime Ice and Clear Ice?",
    "answer": "Rime ice forms when small SCWD come into contact with an airframe surface colder than 0°C. Small SCWD freeze almost instantaneously. The rapid freezing traps tiny air bubbles making rime ice look opaque and white. Because the droplets freeze instantly, rime ice builds forwards into the air flow. Clear ice is much more hazardous than rime ice because it is heavier, tougher, affects a greater surface area and is difficult to remove. It is a hazard to navigation because clear ice forming in flight causes jammed controls and degraded aerodynamic performance resulting in loss of control. Clear ice is almost transparent and has a glass-like appearance. It forms when the leading edges of the airframe (below 0°C) come into contact with large SCWD.",

    "question": "What are the problems with piston engine icing?",
    "answer": "- Carburettor Icing: This is the most common type of induction system icing. It is caused by a combination of the temperature drop due to fuel vapourisation and the reduction in pressure at the carburettor venturi. The temperature reduction may be as much as 20-30°C. Ice gradually builds up, constricting the venturi and progressively reducing engine power. Conventional float-type carburettors are more prone to this type of icing than those equipped with a pressure jet. The problem is most acute in warm, moist conditions with the throttle at or close to idle. - Intake (Impact) Ice: This refers to ice which builds up on air intakes, filters and carburettor heat intakes or alternate air valves etc. Impact ice can accumulate in snow, sleet or sub-zero temperature clouds, or in rain when the temperature of the rain or the aircraft is below 0°C. Less commonly it can occur when flying through super-cooled rain. This type of icing affects fuel injection systems as well as carburettor systems. Impact ice builds up most rapidly at about -4°C in conditions in which visible ice is forming on other parts of the aircraft. - Fuel Icing: Fuel icing is the freezing of water held in suspension in the fuel. Frozen water can block fuel pipes, leading to the loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.",

    "question": "What are the disadvantages of a fixed-pitch propeller?",
    "answer": "The disadvantage of a fixed-pitch propeller is that it only produces its maximum efficiency (i.e., best blade angle/pitch for rpm speed) at one predetermined engine rpm, altitude, and forward airspeed condition. This is so because the forward airspeed affects the blade angle of attack (an increase in forward airspeed causes a decrease in blade angle of attack, which reduces the rearward air displacement and thereby decreases the thrust produced), and therefore, propeller efficiency is reduced away from its single predetermined condition. Therefore, for a fixed-pitch propeller, a single setting must be made between the blade angle (and therefore the angle of attack and pitch) desirable for takeoff and that required for cruise conditions. And if a blade angle for high-speed cruise is chosen (coarse), then the aircraft has the disadvantage of poor propeller performance for takeoff, and vice versa.",

    "question": "Explain why an aircraft stalls.",
    "answer": "An aircraft stalls when the streamlined/laminar airflow (or boundary layer) over the wing’s upper surface, which produces lift, breaks away from the surface when the critical angle of attack is exceeded, irrespective of airspeed, and becomes turbulent, causing a loss in lift (i.e., the turbulent air on the upper surface creates a higher air pressure than on the lower surface). The only way to recover is to decrease the angle of attack (i.e., relax the back pressure and/or move the control column forward).",
